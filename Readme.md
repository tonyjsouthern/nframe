## N-Frame

## Description:
N-Frame allows a user to take a screenshot from their phone, select the corresponding phone or a different one and
insert that screenshot into a frame of their phone. The user can then save the frame of their phone as an image.

## Features to be implemented:
* Font Sizes and Choices
* Editing for frames saved on MyFrames
* Background blur toggle
* More devices
* Device Search

## notes:
The idea of this application came from browsing the Google Play Store and seeing the images hosted on application pages.
